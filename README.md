## 🧠 Project Synopsis

**Securatrix** is a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** project designed to implement an affordable and efficient **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solution tailored for **small businesses**.  

The project emphasizes the use of open-source tools such as **Wazuh** to collect, analyze, and respond to security events across endpoints and servers. Our goal is to empower small organizations with enterprise-grade visibility and active threat detection capabilities without the heavy costs usually associated with commercial SOC systems.
